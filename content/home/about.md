# Biography

I'm an associate research scholar at Princeton University, where I work in NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory as part of the Cooperative Institute for Modeling the Earth System. My research focuses on influences of climate on estuaries and regional oceans, from over very short time scales (can we predict water temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen over the next month from subseasonal atmospheric model forecasts?) to much longer time scales (how will climate change in this century change dissolved oxygen, salinity, and estuarine circulation?). To do so, I employ both numerical modeling (using ROMS and FVCOM, and recently using MOM6) and statistical models and machine learning.
